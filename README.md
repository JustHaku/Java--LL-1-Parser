# Java--LL-1-Parser
An LL(1) Parser created to model the parse tree of a grammar by using recursive descent.

This project was undertaken as part of a university assignment and goes through all the stages of compiling a given file. (Lexical, syntatic and semantic analysis)

Compile.java acts as the main driver and parses through the program files included in the programs folder when run.

The parse results for each program are shown in the Results text file created after the program is run.
